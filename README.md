# Ajava
A reservation system made as as final work for my vocational studies. Uses HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL and Bootstrap as a framework. The database can be found from /sql. You need a separate database "ajava" and a user with the same name.

Might contain some bugs, as the system is 3 years old and there were for example many hardcoded links which I fixed.

Admin interface can be found at <project-directory>/admin. There are 2 users in the database dump, normal and admin. They have different navigations and their credentials can be configured
